[Experimental Unit Description] California public K-12 schools in AY2015-16

[Number of Observations] 10,453
                    
[Number of Features] 28

[Data Source] The file http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/documents/frpm1516.xls
was downloaded and edited to produce file frpm1415-edited.xls by deleting
worksheet "Title Page", deleting row 1 from worksheet "FRPM School-Level Data",
reformatting column headers in "FRPM School-Level Data" to remove characters
disallowed in SAS variable names, and setting all cell values to "Text" format


[Data Dictionary] http://www.cde.ca.gov/ds/sd/sd/fsspfrpm.asp

[Unique ID Schema] The columns "County Code", "District Code", and "School Code"
form a composite key, which together are equivalent to the unique id column 
CDS_CODE 
in dataset dropouts17, and which together are also equivalent to the unique id 
column CDS in dataset act17.
