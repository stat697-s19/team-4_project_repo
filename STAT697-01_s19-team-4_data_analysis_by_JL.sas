Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1516
to the column of the same name from frpm1617.

Limitations: Values of "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" equal to zero should
be excluded from this analysis, since they are potentially missing data values

Methodology: Use proc sort to create a temporary sorted table in descending
order by FRPM_Percentage_Point_Increase, with ties broken by school name. Then
use proc report to print the first ten rows of the sorted dataset.

Followup Steps: More carefully clean values in order to filter out any possible
illegal values, and better handle missing data and outliers, e.g., by using a
previous year's data or a rolling average of previous years' data as a proxy.

Note: This compares the column "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" from frpm1617
to the column PCTGE21 from act17.

Limitations: Values of "Percent (%) Eligible Free (K-12)" equal to zero should
be excluded from this analysis, since they are potentially missing data values,
and missing values of PctGE21 should also be excluded.

Methodology: Use proc corr to perform a correlation analysis, and then use proc
sgplot to output a scatterplot, illustrating the correlation present.

Followup Steps: A possible follow-up to this approach could use a more formal
inferential technique like linear regression, which could be used to determine
more than the existence of a linear relationship.

Question: Can "Percent (%) Eligible FRPM (K-12)" be used to predict the number
of students dropout? Whatâ€™s the top ten schools were the number of high dropout?

Rationale: This would help identify whether child-poverty levels are associated
with the number of high dropout students, if so, providing a strong indicator
for the types of schools most in need of more help with the FRPM.

Note: This compares the column NUMTSTTAKR from act17 to the column TTD and TTE
from drop17.

Limitations: Values of NUMTSTTAKR and TOTAL(DTOT) equal to zero should be excluded
from this analysis, since they are potentially missing data values.
